 Part 2: Search Ranking Algorithm (Scoring & Weights)
Goal: Decide what shows up first and why.

Prompt:

"Design a search ranking algorithm for GhostNote’s marketplace:

Each note can be ranked based on multiple factors:

Title/content match with user query

Tag/category match

Purchase count (popularity)

View count

Recency (freshness)

Creator trust level (verified, high-rated)

User’s past behavior (if logged in)

Requirements:

Output a clear scoring function or pseudo-algorithm that weighs each factor (e.g., 30% content match, 20% popularity...)

Optional: Create a fallback system if scores are too low (suggest random trending notes)

Keep the system lightweight enough to run on Supabase or an external API

Also suggest:

How to store/update score values in Supabase

How to make scores adaptive over time (e.g., view decay, rising stars)"
