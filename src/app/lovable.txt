"Design a dark-themed Note Detail Page for GhostNote Cards. The page should show:

Full note title at the top

Author name and tags below it

A scrollable preview of the note (first few paragraphs)

A locked blur/fade overlay after the preview with a button: 'Unlock Full Note'

If paid, show price and 'Buy & Unlock' button

If already purchased, show full note content
Keep it clean, readable, with modern fonts and soft-glow highlights. Include a minimal sidebar or footer with share, report, and save options.

Also the navbar should be static across the webpages and add a back button on the navbar to go back.
