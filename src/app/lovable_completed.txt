✅ COMPLETED: Part 2: Search Ranking Algorithm (Scoring & Weights)
Goal: Decide what shows up first and why.

STATUS: FULLY IMPLEMENTED ✅

Implementation Summary:

✅ Multi-factor scoring algorithm with weighted formula:
   - Content Match: 35% (semantic + keyword matching)
   - Popularity: 25% (purchases + views + ratings)
   - Recency: 15% (time-based freshness boost)
   - Creator Trust: 15% (verification + reputation)
   - Personalization: 10% (user behavior patterns)

✅ Fallback system for low-quality results:
   - Triggers when <3 results or top score <0.4
   - Shows trending notes with clear labeling
   - Maintains search context for refinement

✅ Lightweight Supabase implementation:
   - Edge Functions for ranking calculations
   - Optimized SQL functions with proper indexing
   - Vector embeddings for semantic search
   - Analytics tables for tracking and improvement

✅ Adaptive scoring system:
   - Real-time updates for views/purchases/ratings
   - Scheduled batch updates for trending/trust scores
   - Decay mechanisms to prevent stale content dominance
   - Seasonal adjustments for topic relevance

✅ Storage & Update Strategy:
   - Extended notes table with ranking columns
   - User interactions table for personalization
   - Search analytics for performance tracking
   - Background processing for heavy calculations

Original Requirements:
"Design a search ranking algorithm for GhostNote's marketplace:

Each note can be ranked based on multiple factors:

Title/content match with user query

Tag/category match

Purchase count (popularity)

View count

Recency (freshness)

Creator trust level (verified, high-rated)

User's past behavior (if logged in)

Requirements:

Output a clear scoring function or pseudo-algorithm that weighs each factor (e.g., 30% content match, 20% popularity...)

Optional: Create a fallback system if scores are too low (suggest random trending notes)

Keep the system lightweight enough to run on Supabase or an external API
