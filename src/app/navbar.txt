Objective: Enhance the navbar of the GhostNote website to improve its appearance, functionality, and consistency with the website's theme, ensuring a polished and professional user experience.

Tasks:

Update Navbar Background:
Implement a 90% transparent, blackish glassmorphism effect (using blur) for the navbar background across all website sections.
Replace the current behavior where the navbar switches to a solid black background after scrolling past the hero section with the same 90% transparent, blurred blackish glassmorphism effect for consistency.
Enhance Search Bar:
Slightly increase the search bar's size, ensuring it stays within the navbar's boundaries when hovered or focused.
Set the text color inside the search bar to white when the user types.
On mobile devices, modify the search bar behavior to prevent it from expanding to full page when the search icon is clicked. Ensure its styling matches the website's theme.
Improve Mobile Icon Visibility:
Adjust the search and profile icons on mobile devices to use a white color for better visibility.
Ensure the icons' styling aligns seamlessly with the website's theme for a cohesive look.
Update GhostNote Logo:
Redesign the GhostNote logo to match the website's theme, specifically mirroring the design and color of the "DashBoard" text.
Apply the Ethnocentric font (located in the navbar folder) for the logo text.
Refine Sign-In/Login Form:
Change the input boxes' background color in the sign-in/login form from white to a slightly greyish tone that complements the website's theme (refer to the form's CSS file for context).
Add a subtle hover and click effect (e.g., slight scale, shadow, or color change) to the Google, Mobile, and PrivateAccount buttons to improve interactivity while aligning with the website's aesthetic.
Enhance Back Button Navigation:
Ensure the back button in the navbar, when visible on different routes, navigates the user to the previous page they visited.
Requirements:

All changes must align with the GhostNote website's overall theme for a cohesive and professional appearance.
Maintain responsiveness and compatibility across desktop and mobile devices.
Use the Ethnocentric font file from the navbar folder for the logo.
