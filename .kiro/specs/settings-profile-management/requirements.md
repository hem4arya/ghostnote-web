# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Settings Profile Management feature needs to be fixed and enhanced to properly follow the FSR (Feature-Specific Routing) structure, integrate correctly with Supabase profiles table, and improve the user experience with proper blur effects. This feature allows users to manage their profile information including username and bio, with data persistence in Supabase.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access my settings page through a properly structured FSR architecture, so that the codebase follows consistent patterns and maintainability standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the settings feature is accessed THEN the app/settings/page.tsx SHALL act only as a gateway component
2. WHEN the settings page loads THEN the actual implementation SHALL be located in components/settings following FSR structure
3. WHEN the settings components are organized THEN they SHALL follow the established FSR pattern with pages, components, hooks, and types directories
4. WHEN importing settings functionality THEN all exports SHALL be properly organized through barrel exports (index.ts files)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want my profile data to be properly fetched from the Supabase profiles table, so that my settings page displays accurate and up-to-date information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the settings page loads THEN the system SHALL fetch profile data from the Supabase profiles table using the correct environment configuration
2. WHEN the Supabase client is initialized THEN it SHALL use the environment variables from .env.local (NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL and NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)
3. WHEN profile data is fetched THEN the system SHALL handle loading states, error states, and success states appropriately
4. WHEN the user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect or show appropriate authentication prompts
5. WHEN profile data is missing THEN the system SHALL handle the case gracefully with appropriate fallbacks

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to edit and save my profile information (username and bio), so that I can maintain an up-to-date public profile.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I edit my username THEN the system SHALL validate the input and update the profiles table in Supabase
2. WHEN I edit my bio THEN the system SHALL allow up to 500 characters and update the profiles table in Supabase
3. WHEN I save my profile changes THEN the system SHALL show loading states during the save operation
4. WHEN the save operation completes successfully THEN the system SHALL show a success toast notification
5. WHEN the save operation fails THEN the system SHALL show an error toast notification with appropriate error message
6. WHEN profile data is updated THEN the local state SHALL be updated to reflect the changes immediately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the user dropdown menu to have a proper blur background effect, so that it's more visually appealing and easier to read against different backgrounds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user dropdown is opened THEN the dropdown background SHALL have a visible blur effect using backdrop-blur
2. WHEN the dropdown is displayed THEN it SHALL maintain proper contrast and readability
3. WHEN the blur effect is applied THEN it SHALL be consistent with the overall design system
4. WHEN the dropdown is closed THEN the blur effect SHALL be properly removed

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all TypeScript errors and warnings to be resolved, so that the codebase maintains high quality and type safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the code is compiled THEN there SHALL be no TypeScript errors related to missing imports
2. WHEN React hooks are used THEN there SHALL be no missing dependency warnings
3. WHEN variables are declared THEN there SHALL be no unused variable warnings
4. WHEN components are exported THEN they SHALL have proper TypeScript interfaces and types
5. WHEN the useProfile hook is implemented THEN it SHALL properly handle the fetchProfile dependency in useEffect

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the settings page to display my account information (member since, last updated), so that I can see when my profile was created and last modified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the profile data is loaded THEN the system SHALL display the created_at date as "Member since"
2. WHEN the profile data is loaded THEN the system SHALL display the updated_at date as "Last updated"
3. WHEN dates are displayed THEN they SHALL be formatted in a user-friendly format (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY)
4. WHEN the profile is updated THEN the "Last updated" date SHALL be automatically updated to the current timestamp
