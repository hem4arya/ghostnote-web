# Auth Package

Authentication and authorization system for the GhostNote application.

## Overview

This package provides user authentication, authorization, and session management functionality. Currently contains placeholder implementations that need to be developed.

## Architecture

```

│   ├── AuthForm.tsx   # Login/signup form
│   ├── AuthModal.tsx  # Authentication modal
│   └── PrivateAccountSetup.tsx  # Account setup
├── hooks/             # Authentication hooks
│   └── index.ts       # useAuth hook
├── types/             # TypeScript definitions

└── index.ts           # Package exports
```

## Features (Planned)

- User authentication (login/signup)
- Session management
- Role-based authorization
- Password validation
- OAuth integration
- Account setup flows

## Current Status

⚠️ **This package contains placeholder implementations**

The auth package structure is set up but requires implementation of:
1. Actual authentication components
2. Supabase auth integration
3. Session management
4. Security utilities
5. Authorization checks

## Usage (Planned)

```tsx
import { useAuth, AuthModal } from "@ghostnote/auth";

function App() {
  const { user, isAuthenticated, login, logout } = useAuth();
  
  return (
    <div>
      {isAuthenticated ? (
        <UserDashboard user={user} onLogout={logout} />
      ) : (
        <AuthModal onLogin={login} />
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Development Priority

This package needs to be implemented as a high priority since authentication is core to the application functionality.
