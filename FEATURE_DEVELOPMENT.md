# 🚀 Feature-Based Development Workflow

Your Next.js project is now optimized for feature-based development where you can work on individual features in isolation while maintaining full app functionality.

## 📁 Project Structure

```

```

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Working on a Feature

1. **Open Feature Workspace**
   ```bash
   cd src/app/homepage
   code homepage.code-workspace
   ```

2. **Start Development Server** (from project root)
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Work in Feature Folder**
   - Edit files in `src/app/homepage/`
   - See changes at `http://localhost:3000/homepage`
   - Hot-reload works automatically

### Import Strategy

#### ✅ Local Imports (Relative)
Use for files within the same feature:
```typescript
import HeroSection from './components/HeroSection';
import { useFeature } from './hooks/useFeature';
import { helpers } from './utils/helpers';
import type { FeatureState } from './types';
```

#### ✅ Global Imports (Absolute)
Use for shared components, utilities, and other features:
```typescript
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';
import { supabase } from '@/lib/supabase';
import AuthModal from '@/features/auth/components/AuthModal';
import { cn } from '@/lib/utils';
```

## 🛠 Creating New Features

### Option 1: Use the Generator Script
```bash
./create-feature.sh dashboard
# Creates src/app/dashboard/ with full structure
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup
1. Create feature directory: `mkdir src/app/my-feature`
2. Copy structure from `src/app/homepage/`
3. Update names and imports
4. Create workspace file

## 📝 Configuration Details

### TypeScript Configuration
- **Root `tsconfig.json`**: Base configuration with `baseUrl: "src"`
- **Feature `tsconfig.json`**: Extends root config with feature-specific paths
- **Path Aliases**: 
  - `@/*` → Global imports from `src/`
  - `./` → Relative imports within feature

### VSCode Workspace Benefits
- ✅ Focused development environment
- ✅ Feature-specific IntelliSense
- ✅ Automatic import suggestions
- ✅ Root access for dev server commands

### Hot Reload & Performance
- ✅ Fast refresh on file changes
- ✅ TypeScript checking per feature
- ✅ Isolated development without affecting other features
- ✅ Full app context maintained

## 🎯 Key Principles

### 1. **Feature Isolation**
- Each feature contains its own components, hooks, utils, types
- Minimal dependencies between features
- Clear boundaries and responsibilities

### 2. **Import Hierarchy**
```
Local (relative) → Shared (absolute) → External (node_modules)
./components     → @/components      → react, next, etc.
```

### 3. **Scalable Structure**
- Add new features without touching existing ones
- Consistent patterns across all features
- Easy to understand and onboard new developers

## 🚦 Development Commands

### From Project Root
```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build entire project
npm run lint         # Lint all files
```

### From Feature Directory
```bash
code feature.code-workspace  # Open feature workspace
# Then run npm run dev from integrated terminal (root)
```

## 📋 Best Practices

### ✅ Do's
- Use relative imports for feature-internal files
- Use absolute imports for shared/global resources
- Keep feature logic contained within feature folder
- Document your components and hooks in README.md
- Use TypeScript interfaces for better development experience

### ❌ Don'ts
- Don't import directly between features (use shared folder)
- Don't duplicate shared logic (move to @/shared/ or @/lib/)
- Don't mix relative and absolute imports for the same resource
- Don't skip documentation in README.md

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Import Issues
1. Check if path exists in `tsconfig.json` paths
2. Verify relative path is correct (`./` for same directory)
3. Use absolute import for global resources (`@/`)

### TypeScript Errors
1. Reload VSCode window: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Reload Window"
2. Check feature `tsconfig.json` extends root config
3. Verify imports use correct paths

### Hot Reload Not Working
1. Ensure dev server runs from project root
2. Check file watchers aren't excluded
3. Restart development server

## 🎉 Ready to Develop!

Your project is now set up for efficient feature-based development. Each feature can be developed in isolation while maintaining full app functionality and hot-reload capabilities.

**Next Steps:**
1. Open `src/app/homepage/homepage.code-workspace` in VSCode
2. Run `npm run dev` from project root
3. Start building your features!
